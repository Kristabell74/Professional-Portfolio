# Professional-Portfolio
#### Kristabell Johnson

##### Why Built:
This portfolio was built to show who I am as a developer. It includes links to the gitlab repository and a look of the sites built. It also includes a link to my LinkedIn page. At the bottom of the resume page is a link to a pdf copy of my resume. 

##### Installation:

I copied my original portfolio and created a professional portfolio. A repository was created in Github. As I worked information would be pushed into Github. A resume was added to the website. On the resume are links to Gitlab, LinkedIn and a PDF copy  of the resume. All of the pages have been slighly modified to be more unform. 

##### Usage:
1. The user goes to the site via the link and has the option to look at the index page. 
2. The user goes to the navigation bar and has the option to go to the Index, Contact and Resume pages. 
3. Next they choose to go to the portfolio page and look at the pictures.
4. Then they can go to the resume page and look at the resume.
5. On the resume is an icon link to my Linkedin. 
6. Also on the resume is a link to my gitlab repository.
7. At the bottom of the resume page is an option to link to a pdf of the resume to print. 
8. The user can then navigate to the contact page and email me.
9. All of the pages are easy to navigate and they have fantastic background pictures.
