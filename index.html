                                    <p>Web development was something that I had never considered in the past. Looking up
                                        all of the coding and understanding how to put it together looked daunting and
                                        overwhelming. When I got out of college I pursued my dream of owning
                                        a business. I Started out in basic jobs and trying to figure out what type of
                                        business to open. Always thinking about the arts and crafts that I enjoyed
                                        working on in my free time I believed I would build a business with arts
                                        crafts or sewing. Little did I know that one person would change the direction
                                        of the dream.
                                    </p>
                                    <p> When traveling with Disney on Ice when I met my future husband Driss on the 16th
                                        street mall bus in Denver CO. I did not expect to marry Driss. After 4 years of
                                        dating each other we got married. When we decided to have kids. I wanted to stay
                                        home and raise the kids sn my husband supported this decision. Driss wanted to
                                        start a limo company so we started a limo service. This way I could work in the
                                        office and drive plus take care of the kids and household. My husband drives and
                                        maintains the vehicles. We have been running the business since 2004

                                    <p>Running a business has its quarks. Since I deal with all of the office work and
                                        most of the advertising I know how frustrating it is to work with web
                                        development companies and other people in order to build up presence on the
                                        internet. It is not easy to get things done properly or fixed once something has
                                        been designed.

                            <p>Last year while working with a web development company we had a great site built.
                                When we decided to leave the company after the year contract was up the company haded
                                the website to us in pieces and told us to put it together. It was a mess. At this point
                                I had already researched and started to learn coding online through Khan Academy and
                                articles. I wanted to build a new site or fix the current site so that it works. The
                                current site is a disaster.
                            </p>
                            <p>When I was on FaceBook I saw the Coding BootCamp for University of Denver. Since I was
                                frustrated with the way things were going and the bits and pieces of stuff I was
                                learning online I wanted to take the course. Overwhelmed and intimidated by the thought
                                of going to these classes I still wanted to try to learn coding. I really wanted to
                                learn how to build beautiful, practical, working, and functional websites. Knowing it
                                will not be easy I will do my best. I hope to be able to not only build a better website
                                but to possibly work on building websites for others. I am exited to see the
                                opportunities and doors that learning how to code will open.
